# imise-beamertheme

THEME STILL UNDER CONSTRUCTION

New LaTeX beamer presentation theme with the IMISE corporate identity, which is mandatory for student presentations.
This is an alternative to the power point templates for fellow LaTeX users.
The new theme does not use Futura anymore, so that a separate download of licenced fonts is not required!

The old XeLaTeX beamer theme that was in use until October 2018 can be found at https://github.com/IMISE/imise-beamertheme-old.
